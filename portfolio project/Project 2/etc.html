<p> It was an ordinary school day. The room looked the same, the people looked the same, the atmosphere was the same. The class started. It was the same. The words coming out of the teachers mouth were also, the same. As a student started presenting his work, you could see from outside a girl sitting down on a bench. She had pink hair, pink coat, pink dress, pink nails. It was a day to remember. </p>
	
<p>As you start to observe her, everything was falling into place: the way she played with her hair, the way she moved while talking on the phone, smoking a cigarette at the same time. Even though you couldn't hear her voice, you could easily imagine how it was: soft, loud but not too loud. Looking at her could make you feel like the world outside was not so bad. Like the ambulances and police cars were not so loud. Like the fact that the L train was not working that day suddenly was not a problem anymore.</p>

<p>The class continued to happen while she continued to talk one the phone. She stood up and started to walk on circles. Actually, walk may be too rough. “Dancing” sounds more appropriate. As she danced outside, surrounded by trees and fresh air, laughing and smiling, the classroom seemed more suffocating than ever - until you got drowned by that sweet daydream.</p>

<p>It takes a little while to notice you have been hypnotized. It takes even longer to go back to your sober self. But dreams are not meant to last forever and once you wake up, reality  manages to strike you even harder as you go back to the real world. Suddenly, the teachers voice started to turn into words again and your eyes get back to some student presentation. So you look outside again, hoping you could go back to that dream. “Just five more minutes” is what you keep telling yourself. But no matter how hard you want to go back, the dream is gone. And whats left is a cigarette butt, stepped on, proving it was real.</p>
